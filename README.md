# Smart Oxygen Mask
The objective of this project is to create an oxygen mask 
that monitors the aspects like temperature, humidity, time 
reminder, suffocation, oxygen saturation. It also gives 
notifications if the person is trying to remove mask.

## Components Used

## Working 
An oxygen mask with a multi-vital monitoring system in it 
is a crucial implementation nowadays. To achieve we have 
to make use of various sensors that keep an eye on the every 
measurement of the patient.

We take proximity sensor to alert us when the mask is not 
on or if someone removes the mask from the patient. Also 
we have to install infrared temperature sensor with the 
humidity monitoring sensor to check the humidity around 
the patient's face. Many deaths happened by suffocation and 
humidity variance around the patient. 

To this we need to add pulse-oximeter and heart rate 
measuring meter to check the condition of the patient's heart 
health and monitor it. Also, any changes that are unexpected 
in the heart health can be intimated using this sensing. 
The IoT device attached to the mask processes and screens 
the body's essential factors such as temperature and blood 
oxygen levels etc., and monitors the humidity levels that 
develop inside the mask layers over a period.

The output of the surrounding and in mask temperature, 
humidity around the patient, oxygen levels from the 
oximeter and heart rate readings are to be shown as the 
output through the "Blynk Software" and we can stay 
updated about the patient's condition anywhere and anytime 
using this software.

The BLINK MOBILE APP developed for Android and IOS 
is cloud-based remote patient monitoring and health 
assessment tool that tracks vital parameters like fever, blood 
oxygen levels, and migraine due to the pressure differences 
in altitudes and provides instant data for doctors to remotely 
monitor the patient in home isolation

## Applications 
• IoT enabled smart mask can be employed not just 
in hospitals but also in the houses where home 
treatment is going on.

• It is specially to reduce the machinery of 
measuring vitals.

• Old people can use it with ease.

• The alarming system helps the parents of the 
treatment on going children to notice if they have 
removed the mask.

• The smart oxygenmask helps COVID-19 warriors to 
efficiently monitor patients through their 
smartphones and thereby reducing the time, they 
spent in the isolation ward to collect basic 
parameters, which reduces the risks of them 
being infected

## Conclusion
The IoT device attached to the mask processes and screens 
the body's essential factors such as temperature and blood 
oxygen levels etc, and monitors the humidity levels that 
develop inside the mask layers over a period. It helps 
COVID-19 warriors to efficiently monitor patients through 
their smartphones and thereby reducing the time, they spent 
in the isolation ward to collect basic parameters, which 
reduces the risks of them being infected.
